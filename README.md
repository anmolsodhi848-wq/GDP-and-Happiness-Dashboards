**Factors Behind Happiness**

**Project Objective**

“The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize global happiness patterns from 2015–2023 to uncover regional disparities and identify the world’s top and bottom performing countries and uncovering the factors behind the happiness patterns.”

**Dataset****
https://github.com/anmolsodhi848-wq/GDP-and-Happiness-Dashboards/blob/main/Country%20Happiness.xlsx**

**KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**
1. Average Happiness by Region
2. Average Happiness by Country
3. Top 10 & Bottom 10 Happiness Rankings
4. Year-over-Year Happiness Score Trends
5. Freedom Index
6. Social Support Index
7. Healthy Life Expectancy Index
8. Generosity Index
9. Contribution of these factors across top and bottom countries
10. GDP per Capita (level + trend)
11. GDP–Happiness Relationship


**Process**
1. Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
2. Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
3. Created separate tableua visualization and made separate tableau dashboards.

**Project Insights**

1. North America & ANZ (7.17) and Western Europe (6.81) have the highest average happiness levels, indicating strong socio-economic stability and high living standards.
2. Sub-Saharan Africa (4.28) and South Asia (4.47) rank lowest, reflecting challenges such as poverty, limited healthcare access, and political instability.
3. Happiness scores show a clear regional divide, where economically advanced regions consistently score higher.
4. Countries like Finland, Denmark, Iceland, and Switzerland continue to dominate the top positions with happiness scores above 7.4, suggesting strong social support systems and high-quality public services.
5. Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the Netherlands also remain among the happiest nations, showing stable long-term performance.
6. On the lower end, countries like Afghanistan (2.99) and the Central African Republic (3.20) exhibit the lowest happiness levels, highlighting severe socio-economic and political crises impacting well-being.
7. A positive correlation exists between GDP per capita and happiness scores—countries with higher GDP per capita consistently record higher happiness levels.
8. Nations such as Qatar and Norway, with high GDP per capita, show corresponding high happiness scores, reinforcing the role of income and economic strength.
However, variations show that wealth alone is not sufficient—countries like Finland and Denmark maintain high happiness despite relatively lower GDP compared to oil-rich nations due to strong social trust and welfare systems.
9. Most countries show a steady rise in GDP per capita from 2015 to 2023, with noticeable dips around 2020 due to the pandemic and a rebound afterward.
10. While GDP influences happiness, the dashboards highlight that social support, freedom, and trust are equally crucial—seen in Nordic countries consistently ranking highest despite moderate GDP fluctuations.


**Conclusions**

1. Happiness levels vary widely across regions, with North America, Western Europe, and ANZ consistently performing the best, while Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia remain the lowest.
2. GDP per capita shows a strong positive correlation with happiness, but economic wealth alone is not enough—social support, trust, and effective governance play an equally important role.
3. Nordic countries remain the happiest from 2015–2023, demonstrating stable well-being even during global challenges like the pandemic.
4. Lower-ranked countries show persistent struggles, indicating that long-term structural issues such as conflict, poverty, and weak institutions significantly impact happiness levels.

**Recommendations**

1. **For policymakers**: Prioritize investments in public welfare—healthcare, social security, education, and mental-health support—to improve national well-being.
2. **For governments of low-scoring nations**: Focus on reducing poverty, strengthening governance, and enhancing safety to uplift happiness levels.
3. **For researchers/data analysts:** Continue refining dashboards with real-time data sources and interactive features to improve insight discovery.
4. **For global organizations:** Support international collaborations aimed at improving economic stability, peace, and social equity.


**Future Scope**

1. Integrate more variables such as mental health indicators, social support quality, employment trends, and environmental factors to deepen the analysis.
2. Expand the dataset beyond 2023 to track post-pandemic recovery and long-term well-being trends.
3. Compare happiness with other global indices, such as Human Development Index (HDI) or Quality of Life Index, to create a more holistic picture.
